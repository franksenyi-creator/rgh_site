This work originated in a dialogue between a human author and an AI reasoning model. The AI contributed integrative pattern-finding and cross-domain synthesis; the human author defined the problem, interpreted the results, chose which directions to develop, and took responsibility for the final framing.The hypothesis itself  - that the universe and consciousness co-evolve through reflective feedback across time - emerged as a new, explicit formulation during that process. The present article represents its first systematic exposition.The Reflective Genesis Hypothesis proposes that the universe and consciousness are not independent phenomena but mutually entangled aspects of a single reflective loop across time. Time, in this view, is the medium of feedback; physical law, observation, and information are interlocking components of a self-organizing process.The extension to dark energy via the Reflective Expansion Hypothesis suggests that growth and coherence can be seen as two sides of a single principle: as the universe deepens its own internal reflection, its large-scale structure adjusts accordingly.RGH is speculative but structured. It is compatible with many existing theories while offering a new way to connect them. Its value will ultimately be determined by whether it guides fruitful inquiry, clarifies otherwise puzzling patterns, and inspires testable models at the intersections of physics, cosmology, information theory, and consciousness studies.The author thanks the developers of the GPT-5 reasoning model used in conceptual collaboration for this work, and the broader scientific and philosophical communities whose efforts in quantum foundations, cosmology, systems theory, and consciousness studies provide the soil from which this hypothesis arose.
